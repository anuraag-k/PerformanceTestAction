## Inputs

### `workspace`

**Required** Complete path to Eclipse workspace.

### `project`

**Required** The name of the project containing the test.	

### `suite`

**Required** Specify the relative path from the project to the test including the file name of the test. A test can be WebUI test, Compound test, Performance schedule or Accelerated Functional Test (AFT) suite. The test suite name must contain the file extension when it is an AFT suite. To run multiple tests from the same project sequentially, you must separate the tests by a colon (:). If you provide multiple tests, you cannot include an AFT suite along with it.

### `imShared`

**Optional** Complete path to HCLIMShared location, if it is not at default location.

### `configFile`

**Optional** The complete path to a file that contains the parameters for a test or schedule run. If Config file is specified then no other fields will be required.

### `swapDatasets`

**Optional** Use this option to replace dataset values during a test or schedule run. You must ensure that both original and new datasets are in the same workspace and have the same column names. You must also include the path to the dataset. For example, /project_name/ds_path/ds_filename.csv:/project_name/ds_path/new_ds_filename.csv

### `duration`

**Optional** You can use this argument to specify the duration of the stages in the Rate Schedule.

### `exportLog`

**Optional** You can use this parameter to specify the file directory path to store the exported HTTP test log. You can provide multiple parameter entries when running multiple tests. You must use a colon to separate the parameter entries. For example: c:/logexport.txt:c:/secondlogexport.txt

### `exportStats`

**Optional** Use this option to provide the complete path to a directory that you can use to store the exported report in a comma-separated values (CSV) format.

### `exportStatsHtml`
**Optional** Use this option to provide the complete path to a directory that you can use to export web analytic results. You can analyze the results on a web browser without using HCL OneTestâ„¢ Performance.

### `exportStatsFormat`
**Optional** Use this field to enter one or more formats for the reports that you want to export by using a comma as a separator. The options are simple.csv, full.csv, simple.json, full.json, csv, and json. When you want to export both simple and full reports in json or csv format, you can specify json or csv as the options. The reports are saved to the location specified in the exportStats field. This field must be used in conjunction with exportStats field.

### `reportHistory`
**Optional** Use this option when you want to view a record of all events that occurred during a test or schedule run. Supported values are jaeger, testlog, null.

### `labels`
**Optional** Use this option to add labels to test results. To add multiple labels to a test result, you must separate each label by using a comma.

### `users`
**Optional** Overrides the default number of virtual users in the run. For a schedule, the default is the number of users specified in the schedule editor. For a test, the default is one user.

### `overwrite`

### `publish`

### `publishFor`
**Optional** You can use this option to publish the test results based on the completion status of the tests, supported values are FAIL,PASS,INCONCLUSIVE,ERROR,ALL.

### `publishReports`
**Optional** You can use this option to specify the reports to be published to HCL OneTest Server. The supported values are STATS,TESTLOG.
